# Ethical-Hacking-using-Socket-Programming

## Socket
Is one of the endpoint of two-way connection link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so
that TCP layer can identify the application to which the data is destined to be. An endpoint is a combination of IP address and port number.

## IP Address
It is an unique set of strings separated by full stops('.') such that two computer systems can communicate with each other using Internet
Protocol over the network. 
They are of two types:
```
                                                IP
                                               `   `
                                              `     `
                                             `       `
                                          Public    Private 
```
